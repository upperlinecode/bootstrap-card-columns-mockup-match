# Card Columns Inspiration Wall

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/bootstrap-card-columns-mockup-match)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/bootstrap-card-columns-mockup-match)

## The Setup

You're making an inspiration wall for your job as a developer!

The idea is to have inspiring quotes and images that will motivate you.

Before you get too deep into it, you asked your boss to review your first pass at a layout - it obviously isn't done, most of this is just what you found on the documentation for a basic nav and card layout called "card columns," but you want to get her approval before you put a lot more time into it.

She sent you the feedback listed below in the lab section. Incorporate as much of her feedback as you can in one hour.

## The Lab

Incorporate your as much of your boss's feedback as you can in the time we have. Here's the list of thougts she sent over:

1. This layout is awesome! Looks like we still have "lorem ipsum" placeholder text on some of them. Can you replace that with your favorite inspirational quotes?
2. I've decided I want the card with the black image to have one of those "hang in there" cats climbing a tree. Can you swap the image out for one of those?
3. The card with the purple image should probably also be familiar image. Can we do success kid on that one? Just Google "success kid" if you have any trouble finding it.
4. Now that I think about it, Success kid is going to need a powerful quote on his card. Can you find one and put it on the card please?
5. I don't really have an idea for a quote about the painting - maybe you should pick your favorite inspirational meme or poster to replace that one. Then you can adjust the text to match.
6. I love that we have one blue card - I think it really pops. Can you make the one with "Failure is Just Unfinished Learning" on it blue in the same way?
7. I think that leaves two cards that aren't finished - can we put advice on those two? Something like a title that says "How to Relax" on one (with a tip for how to do it) and maybe "How to Motivate Yourself" on the other.
8. Can we remove the "last updated 3 minutes ago" text from the cards that have it? I don't think it adds much.
9. Right now we have 8 cards, but I honestly think it would look better with 9. Can we add another card? Pick whichever type you think is working best, just make sure we get 9 total.


## The Stretches

These parts are optional - your boss's feedback marked them as non-urgent, but if you're after a challenge and you have time left over in your hour, you should try them.

1. The Nav bar needs some love. Can you clean that up a little bit? It needs real links to useful sites.
2. Can you add a footer component to the page? I'm not sure which kind would be best, but I'd like it to match the color & theme of the one up top.
3. The title could be so much better. Can we replace that h1 with Bootstrap Jumbotron? It's a pretty cool component.
4. Can we get some buttons on our advice cards? I'd like them to take you to videos that might help - like if you click a "try it!" button on the "how to relax" card, it might take you to a meditation video or a youtube tutorial.
5. If you shrink your browser SUPER small, it all goes into one column, which is great for our mobile users, but I noticed that if you shrink it a medium amount you get three REALLY skinny columns that look weird. Can we see if we can get it so that when you shrink it down a medium amount, you can make it have only two columns? This one's not super important, I don't think a lot of folks will be using our site on medium-sized screens, but it'd still be nice to have.
